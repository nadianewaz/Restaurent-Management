           <h3>Ingredients
for 6 servings</h3>

Nonstick vegetable oil spray
¼ cup sliced almonds
4 oz. bittersweet chocolate (must be at least 60% cacao in order for the fudge to set properly), broken or chopped into small pieces if needed
½ ripe avocado
⅓ cup pure maple syrup
⅓ cup almond butter
1 Tbsp. cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-processed
¾ tsp. kosher salt
Flaky sea salt

<br>
<br>

Preparation:
<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat a 9x5" loaf pan with nonstick spray. Line with parchment paper, leaving plenty of overhang on 2 sides (the spray will help it stick to the pan and stay flat). Spread out almonds on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely crush with a flat-bottomed glass.
Meanwhile, place chocolate in a small glass or ceramic bowl and microwave in 20-second bursts, stirring well between each, until melted and smooth, 1–1½ minutes. Let cool slightly. (Alternatively, heat chocolate, stirring occasionally, in a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of simmering water until melted; do not let bowl touch water.)
Purée avocado, maple syrup, and almond butter in a food processor until very smooth, about 1 minute. Add cocoa powder, kosher salt, and 2 Tbsp. cold water. Pulse until smooth, then add melted chocolate. Pulse just until combined, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
Transfer chocolate mixture to prepared pan and smooth top. Scatter reserved almonds over, then season with sea salt; press in lightly. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Remove by lifting up parchment, then cut into squares or bars to serve.
